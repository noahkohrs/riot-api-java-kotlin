# Riot Api SDK

This will become a full SDK for the Riot API. It is currently in development and is not yet ready for use.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, 
please feel free to fork the repository fill one of the api classes with the necessary endpoints and submit a pull request.
You can copy the template in the `apis.template` package's into the gateway you want to write to get started.

You can also improve overall project's structure if you have some background on it.

ADVANCED TODO-LIST:
If the return format is nice to work with objects, tick the box. If not, leave it empty.
- To do so, we will need to utilize dragontail for the static patch data (example: transform champion id to a whole champion data object)
